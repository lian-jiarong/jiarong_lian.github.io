Hello! I am Jiarong, welcome to my homepage.

I am an undergraduate student at the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am currently doing undergraduate research supervised by [Dr Li-Ta HSU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-hsu-li-ta/) and [Dr Guohao ZHANG](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-zhang-guohao/). My research interests are Navigation, Positioning, 3DMA GNSS, and Sensor Fusion. I also want to try some related areas like Autonomous Driving and Robotic inspired by [Dr Weisong WEN](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-wen-weisong/).
