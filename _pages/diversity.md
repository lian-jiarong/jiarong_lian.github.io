Pursuing my studies in the Asiaâ€™s global city - Hong Kong, I have gained profound insights into the significance of diversity in our academic pursuits and daily lives. Engaging with individuals from varied backgrounds and exchanging ideas from diverse perspectives, we can significantly augment our creative thinking and empathy - attributes that are indispensable for a global citizen. The world is big enough to accommodate different points of view, it is my aspiration to serve as an ambassador, facilitating the exchange of ideas in this diverse world.
