Diversity Statement
======
Pursuing my studies in Asiaâ€™s global city - Hong Kong, I have gained profound insights into the significance of diversity in our academic pursuits and daily lives. Engaging with individuals from varied backgrounds and exchanging ideas from diverse perspectives, we can significantly augment our creative thinking and empathy - attributes that are indispensable for a global citizen. The world is big enough to accommodate different points of view, it is my aspiration to serve as an ambassador, facilitating the exchange of ideas in this diverse world.

Cultural Diversity 
====== 
I was born and raised in Wuhan, a normal city located at the central China. As a native Chinses, I'm very familiar with Chinese society, especially its education system. After finishing my high school study, I went to Hong Kong for my undergraduate study at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. In my second year of undergraduate study, I went to United States of America for semester exchange at University of Folrida. Life and society in China, Hong Kong and United States have a huge difference with its pros and cons, which gives me a thorough understanding about the meaning and importance of diversity. Having open mind to diversity is to help ourselves to step out of our comfort zone and expolre new ideas, which is crucial for me to be a future researcher.
